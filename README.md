# XSRT (Exert)

XSRT is a free and open source session recording tool for web applications. It can be embedded in web applications to allow the owner to record user actions and later play them back as a video. This is useful for tracking hard-to-reproduce bugs and getting a sense of how users are interacting with your application.
